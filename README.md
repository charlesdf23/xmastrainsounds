## Personal Play Area

** Little personal project of file borrowed from other places 
(https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/scare-trick-treaters-diy-motion-activated-soundbox/).  

This is something that I modified with a script, Raspberry PI, breadboard and 
some motion sensors. I couldn't get it to work as is and had to reverse the 
motion/ no motion logic and flip the output to pin 23
